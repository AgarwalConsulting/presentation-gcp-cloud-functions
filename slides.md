# Google Cloud Functions

*...and Cloud Run*

Gaurav Agarwal

---

- No servers to provision, manage, or upgrade

- Automatically scale based on the load

- Integrated monitoring, logging, and debugging capability

- Built-in security at role and per function level based on the principle of least privilege

- Key networking capabilities for hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios

---

## What is Serverless?

- No infra management

- Fully managed security

- Pay only for usage

---

## Available Runtimes

- Node.js (First available)

- *Java 11*

- *Go (1.13 & 1.16 preview)*

- PHP

- Python

- Ruby

---

*Exercise*: Getting our first "Hello from `<your_name>`!" HTTP function out through the UI!

---

- Event-driven
  - Runs code in response to events.

- Scalable
  - Scales automatically without hassle.

- Stateless
  - Cloud Functions donâ€™t hold any in-memory state.

- No management
  - No worries about provisioning and maintaining servers.

- Short lifespan
  - Cloud Function execution time is limited.

Auto load-balancing

---
class: center, middle

Cold-start problem

---

## Numbers to keep in mind

- Limited Memory: 256 MiB

- Max run time: 60 seconds

---

## Types of triggers

### Direct functions

- *HTTP Based*

### Background/*CloudEvent* functions

- *Cloud Pub/Sub*

- *Cloud Storage*

- Cloud Firestore

---

Takes care of:

- details of networking

- autoscaling (even to zero)

- revision tracking

- Universal subscription, delivery, and management of events

The Functions Framework lets you write lightweight functions that run in many different environments, including:

- Google Cloud Functions

- Your local development machine (Yay!)

- Cloud Run and Cloud Run on GKE (*More on this later*)

- [Knative-based environments](https://github.com/knative/)

### Developing functions in: *Java*

#### Java HTTP functions

---

*Import*: `com.google.cloud.functions.*`

```java
public interface HttpFunction {
  /**
   * Called to service an incoming HTTP request. This interface is implemented by user code to
   * provide the action for a given function. If the method throws any exception (including any
   * {@link Error}) then the HTTP response will have a 500 status code.
   *
   * @param request a representation of the incoming HTTP request.
   * @param response an object that can be used to provide the corresponding HTTP response.
   * @throws Exception if thrown, the HTTP response will have a 500 status code.
   */
  void service(HttpRequest request, HttpResponse response) throws Exception;
}

![Cloud Storage](assets/images/cloud-storage.png)

#### Cloud Storage

---
class: center, middle

Google Cloud Storage is a RESTful online file storage web service for storing and accessing data on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure.

It's an object storage service.

---

Programmatic Access:

- `gsutil`

- [Java library](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries)

---
class: center, middle

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>

      <version>22.0.0</version>

</dependencyManagement>

    <artifactId>google-cloud-storage</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

.content-credits[https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries]

---

Uploading files to a Cloud Function using Cloud Storage is a three step process:

- Clients call a Cloud Function directly to retrieve a signed URL.

- Clients then send file data to the signed URL via an HTTP PUT request.

- A second Cloud Function is triggered by the mutation in the storage bucket to further process the file.

.content-credits[https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/http#uploading_files_via_cloud_storage]

---
class: center, middle

#### Background functions

---

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BackgroundFunction<T> {
  /**
   * Called to service an incoming event. This interface is implemented by user code to
   * provide the action for a given background function. If this method throws any exception
   * (including any {@link Error}) then the HTTP response will have a 500 status code.
   *
   * @param payload the payload of the event, deserialized from the original JSON string.
   * @param context the context of the event. This is a set of values that every event has,
   *     separately from the payload, such as timestamp and event type.
   * @throws Exception to produce a 500 status code in the HTTP response.
   */
  void accept(T payload, Context context) throws Exception;
}
```

---

Supported event sources:

- Cloud Storage

- Cloud Pub/Sub

---

Cloud Storage Triggers:

- google.storage.object.finalize (default)

  This event is sent when a new object is created (or an existing object is overwritten, and a new generation of that object is created) in the bucket.

- google.storage.object.delete

  This event is sent when an object is permanently deleted.

- google.storage.object.archive

  This event is sent when a live version of an object is archived or deleted.

- google.storage.object.metadataUpdate

  This event is sent when the metadata of an existing object changes.

.content-credits[https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/storage#functions-calling-storage-java]

---
class: center, middle

Storage event data is delivered in the *Cloud Storage [object](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects#resource)* format.

#### Testing

.content-credits[https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/testing/test-basics]

---

Types of Testing:

- Unit Testing

  Unit tests are narrowly-scoped tests for small, specific parts of your code. These tests can quickly verify assumptions made during the development process, such as handling edge cases and input validation.

- Integration Testing

  Integration tests validate interaction between parts of your code, and typically take a moderate amount of time to complete. For example, in Cloud Functions, integration tests can be used to test a function's usage of other Google Cloud services such as Datastore or Cloud Vision.

- System Tests

  System tests are more complex tests that validate the behavior of your Cloud Function across multiple Google Cloud components in an isolated test environment.
